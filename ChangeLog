	* Interval.pm (intersection): bound+unbound was failing when the
	two defined bounds were identical.

2005-08-26  Tim Jenness  <tjenness@cpan.org>

	* Interval.pm (intersection): Fix unbound+unbound intersections
	(they were wrong when the intervals were bound in the same
	direction

2005-03-10  Tim Jenness  <timj@jach.hawaii.edu>

	* Interval.pm (stringify): Recognize that sometimes min == max
	(contains): If min==max then $range->contains($max)
	(stringify): Add positive definite setting to allow positive
	ranges to be stringified without including the 0
	(stringify): Use Interval Notation for the bound intervals

2005-03-09  Tim Jenness  <timj@jach.hawaii.edu>

	* t/interval.t: Add new tests for == and !=

	* Interval.pm (equate): Fix logic when using incmax/incmin flags
	and when undefs are included

	---- VERSION 0.02 ----
	
	* Interval.pm: Add inc_max and inc_min attributes. Interval can
	now be inclusive (>= and <=). 

2005-02-10  Tim Jenness  <timj@jach.hawaii.edu>

	* Interval.pm: Always returns true for contains() if both bounds
	are undefined.
