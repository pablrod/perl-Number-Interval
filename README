Number::Interval - A representation of a numeric interval

This is release V0.01 of Number::Interval. This module can be used to
specify bound or unbound intervals (ie a max and a min value, a max
only or a min only) and then compare them with other intervals, find
out whether a number is within the interval and provide a stringified form
of the interval.

This is the first release so the interface should be considered
alpha state. Comments welcome.
